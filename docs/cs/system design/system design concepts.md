System design is a crucial skill for programmers, especially when developing complex software applications. Here are the top 10 system design concepts that every programmer should learn:

1. Scalability: Designing systems that can handle increased loads and growing user bases. This involves understanding horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, and distributed systems.
2. Availability and Reliability: Building systems that are highly available and reliable, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistent performance. This includes fault tolerance, redundancy, and backup strategies.
3. Performance Optimization: Optimizing system performance by identifying and addressing bottlenecks, improving response times, reducing latency, and optimizing resource utilization.
4. Data Modeling: Designing effective data models that meet application requirements and ensure efficient data retrieval and manipulation. This includes understanding relational and NoSQL databases, normalization, denormalization, and indexing strategies.
5. Caching: Utilizing caching techniques to improve system performance and reduce database load. This involves using in-memory caching solutions, such as Redis or Memcached, to store frequently accessed data.
6. Message Queueing: Implementing message queueing systems to decouple and scale components of a system. This allows for asynchronous processing, improved fault tolerance, and handling spikes in traffic.
7. Security: Incorporating security measures into system design to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks. This includes understanding authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation, and secure communication protocols.
8. Microservices Architecture: Designing systems as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. This promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
9. Design Patterns: Familiarize yourself with common design patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Observer, Singleton, Factory, and Dependency Injection. These patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design problems.
10. Trade-offs and Constraints: Understanding the trade-offs and constraints involved in system design decisions. This includes considerations like cost, development time, maintainability, and ease of deployment.

Remember that system design is an extensive field, and this list is not exhaustive. It’s important to continuously expand your knowledge and keep up with the latest trends and technologies in the domain of system design.
