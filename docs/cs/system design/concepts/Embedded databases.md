## Embedded databases
An embedded database is essentially a database management system (DBMS) that is tightly integrated within an application's software. Unlike standalone databases which run on dedicated servers and cater to multiple applications, embedded databases run within the application itself, ensuring a seamless data flow with minimal setup and external dependencies.
